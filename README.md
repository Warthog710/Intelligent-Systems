# Intelligent-Systems

#### Description:
Theory and implementation of a variety of techniques used to simulate intelligent behavior. Expert systems, fuzzy logic, neural networks, evolutionary computation, and two-player game-tree search will be covered in depth. Knowledge representation, pattern recognition, hybrid approaches, and handling uncertainty will also be discussed.
