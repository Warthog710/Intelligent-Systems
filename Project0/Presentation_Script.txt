Intro
=====

Welcome to my video presentation for CSC180 project 0, personal introductions

About Me
========

Some quick facts about me, my name is Quinn Roemer (you can just call me Quinn). 
You can see a picture of me to the left. I am currently 22 years old and 
am a 4th year Computer Science student that will be graduating in Spring 2021 
with a Bachelor’s in Computer Science. I enjoy anything to do with computers 
from building systems to programming games, applications, and even web development.


Favorite AI Application
=======================

One of my favorite AI applications that I have come across in my personal research 
is OpenAI’s DOTA 2 bots. What I find extremely impressive about this AI 
application is its ability to work as a team to defeat human teams that are 
commonly seen as pros at the game.

If you want to see these AI bots in action they are some pretty neat videos you
can find on YouTube.

How it works
============

These bots from OpenAI were trained over a period of 10 months using self-play 
reinforcement (meaning they played against themselves with some human guidance). 
The Bot works by examining the game state every 4 frames and performing a 
discrete action from moving around its character(s), attacking the enemy, 
or purchasing upgrades.

The sheer amount of computing power that was required to train these bots was
absoolutely huge.

AI I would like to build
========================

Some AI applications that I would like to build in the future are Automonous 
vehicles (because of the widespread impacts such technology would have 
on our world) 

and Game AI (because the unique problem it poses due to the time constraints 
on computation I.E every frame or so…)

Fun Facts
=========

Some fun facts about me! 
I am currently in the processing of moving to Redding, CA.
I used to volunteer at a soup kitchen where I served food to the homeless
I interned at the Sac Department of Utiltilies for about 1 year
I earned my associates in Computer Science at FLC before transferring to Sac State

Thanks for watching my presentation and I am looking forward to learning more
about you in your video!
